# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the images and other static assets used in the SKYIOUS portfolio website.

## Required Images

Before deploying the website, please replace these placeholder files with your actual images:

1. Compress all images to reduce file size without significantly affecting quality
2. Use modern image formats like WebP where possible
3. Keep image dimensions appropriate for their display size
4. Use descriptive filenames for better organization
